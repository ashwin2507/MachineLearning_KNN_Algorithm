--------------------------

Consider the problem where we want to predict the gender of a person from a set of input parameters, namely height, weight, and age. Implement the KNN algorithm for this problem. Your implementation should work with different training data sets.
----------------
CODE STRUCTURE
-----------------
1. Program: 
KNN_algorithm.py --> Knn with 3 parameters: Height, Weight and Age.

2. The training dataset can be entered in a csv file named gender.csv. The program will split the data into test data and training data, for calculating accuracy.

3. The user will be asked to input k value for KNN, then the predicted class will be displayed.

--------------------
HOW TO RUN THE CODE
--------------------

Command
-------
Make sure you have gender.csv file in the same folder as the code.
python filename.py
